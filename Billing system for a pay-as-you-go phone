Creating a billing system for a pay-as-you-go phone. If the phone_balance is below 550, the system removes 1000 from the bank balance to top up the phone balance. 

phone_balance = 500
bank_balance = 500000
print(phone_balance, bank_balance)

if phone_balance < 550:
  phone_balance += 1000
  bank_balance -= 1000
  
print(phone_balance, bank_balance)
